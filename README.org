* cl-cublas

** Features

- high level wrapper for cublas in lisp, for example ~(multiply A B)~
- automatic deallocation of tensors
- automatic casting casting between the gpu and cpu depending on
  operation.


** Installation

You will require the following in order to use this package:

- CUDA, version 8 and 9 seem to work fine.
- SBCL, maybe other implementations will work.
- Quicklisp

To get started, clone this repository into your Quicklisp
~local-projects~ directory. Ensure that your CUDA lib folder is
available in the ~LD_LIBRARY_PATH~. Run the demos script with ~sbcl
--load demos.lisp~

** Contributing

This is a very young project and started mostly for fun. Contributions
are absolutely welcome, just send a pull request if you want to add
something. :)
